      <h2>WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE?</h2>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
      AI can be thought of as a technological brain that learns through a process called machine learning, which involves the use of examples in order to understand the world. 
      AI systems are fed large amounts of information, which teaches the AI to distinguish the different things it could be asked.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: left;">
      <strong>Dog:</strong> Barks, Big, Hairy, Friendly.<br>
      <strong>Cat:</strong> Small, Scary, Whiskers.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: left;">
      These are characteristics of two different animals: a cat and a dog. These characteristics help answer questions we might have as users. If an AI is trained more effectively, 
      it will be capable of containing characteristics of many different things, which would improve the accuracy of the answers it gives, as it will have a deeper understanding of 
      what is being asked. Using only the limited characteristics provided, if the AI tries to generate a cat, it may produce something that doesn’t resemble either a cat or a dog. 
      However, if more information is fed to the AI, it will eventually understand the true form of something and continuously improve the image it has of that particular thing.

      <h2>AI vs. Traditional Search</h2>
      <p>
        A big comparasion that could be easy to understand is Google and ChatGPT. Both of them can be described as search motors, but ChatGPT is by far the best choice
        a person has in order to look for information. AI has revolutionazed the world, since it's a technology that can pretty much help you to learn and do
        whatever you want whenever you want wherever you are since the only thing you need is internet and maybe a subscription in order to use an AI.
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-align: center;">
        <strong>Reasons to use AI as a search engine</strong>
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        <strong>Time efficiency</strong>: AI condenses tons of information in order to develop your answer, which it takes less time that you would take in order to achieve the same.<br>
        <strong>Direct answers rather than links</strong>: Obviously getting an answer is way better than you looking for one.<br>
        <strong>Convesational interaction</strong>: Makes it more easy to understand since it feels someone is telling you something personally.<br>
        <strong>Personalization</strong>: An AI can modify itself, which means that everyone is capable of modifying their own search engine however they want. Do you want something minimal?
        you can get it in seconds. Or something more colorful could be modified in seconds.<br>
        <strong>Multitasking</strong>: You can ask two questions one after another and get pretty good results, for example asking for a certain bone of the body and then asking the meaning 
        of a certain mathematical equation. This is way harder to achieve with a regular search engine.

      <h2>Personalization</h2>
      <p>
        Personalization plays a major role in the world of AI, as an AI can be taught to perform specific tasks rather than trying to do everything. 
        For example, an AI that is trained exclusively in mathematics will likely provide better and more accurate mathematical answers compared to one trained on general topics. However, 
        the math-focused AI might be harder to understand, as it may use a more technical tone that reflects the data it was trained on.

        Not only is the personalization of the AI itself important, but the interface design of the search engine is also a key part of providing a good service to every user. "A well-designed 
        user interface plays a crucial role in the overall search experience." (Tiemoman KONE 2024) Some of the modifications that can be made include simplicity, accessibility, color schemes, and other visual elements.
        The major difference between the personalization of an AI search engine and a regular one is that an AI search engine can customize itself, meaning each user would have the opportunity to 
        tailor their search engine to their preferences.
      </p>

      <h2>Limitations & Realism</h2>
      <p>
        AI is excellent when it comes to facts and well established information such as the power rule in calculus which is straightforward and technical, making it easier for a computer to process and understand. 
        However, a major challenge arises when dealing with reasoning and more emotional or subjective aspects. AI does not have personal experiences; it simply draws from the information available on the internet. 
        For example, an AI can be described as someone that writes notes for a class, but it doesn’t truly understand the content. Instead, it pulls from countless notes and resources to fill in the gaps in order
        to fully undestand the content of the notes. Meaning that information is needed in order to understand his own information, something that humans can deduce by simply looking at something.
        
        But what happens if there aren't enough notes or reliable information available? That’s where a major issue arises—AI hallucinations. This occurs when an AI generates incorrect or entirely made up information. 
        Hallucinations are one of the biggest problems with AI today, as the spread of false or fabricated facts can have serious consequences if not addressed properly.

        Artificial intelligence chatbots are becoming a major source of information for many people around the world, but the information they provide often lacks reliability, meaning that chatbots should be considered 
        supplementary rather than a primary source of information.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        AI is one of the most important technologies developed in the last decade, as it can be used by anyone to learn something new. 
        It’s a tool that can help with almost anything. A great example of AI being used as a search engine is this website, which was entirely created with the help of ChatGPT. 
        I didn’t know how to build a website, but I wanted to make one. AI helped me understand how websites work, what is required to build one, and even provided the code needed to make it look professional.
        
        I believe this would have been nearly impossible to accomplish in just one day using only Google to find the information—yet I was able to achieve it with the help of AI.

        AI not only has the power to deliver information in seconds but also possesses the ability to assist in decision making. It can help you find information that is more relevant or useful than what you 
        initially searched for. This is something traditional search engines cannot achieve, highlighting a key difference between AI and regular search engines.
